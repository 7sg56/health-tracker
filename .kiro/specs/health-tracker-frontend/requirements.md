# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modern, responsive health tracker frontend application using Next.js 14, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components. The frontend will connect to the existing Spring Boot backend API to provide a complete health tracking experience with authentication, data visualization, and CRUD operations for health metrics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Landing Page and Navigation

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to see an attractive landing page that explains the health tracker app, so that I understand its purpose and can easily navigate to registration or login.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the root URL THEN the system SHALL display a modern landing page with app description and call-to-action buttons

5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL call POST /api/auth/logout and clear local session state
6. WHEN forms have validation errors THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages in real-time
7. WHEN authentication requests are pending THEN the system SHALL show loading indicators

### Requirement 3: Dashboard and Health Overview

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see a comprehensive dashboard with my health metrics and daily score, so that I can quickly understand my current health status.

2. WHEN a user views food history THEN the system SHALL call GET /api/food with pagination and display entries
3. WHEN a user edits a food entry THEN the system SHALL call PUT /api/food/{id} with updated data
4. WHEN a user deletes a food entry THEN the system SHALL call DELETE /api/food/{id} and update the UI
5. WHEN food forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate food items (1-100 chars) and calories (1-5000)
6. WHEN food entries are displayed THEN they SHALL show food item, calories, date, and action buttons

### Requirement 6: Workout Tracking Interface

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to log and manage my workout activities, so that I can track my fitness progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds a workout THEN the system SHALL call POST /api/workouts with activity, duration, and optional calories burned
2. WHEN a user views workout history THEN the system SHALL call GET /api/workouts with pagination
3. WHEN a user edits a workout THEN the system SHALL call PUT /api/workouts/{id} with updated information
4. WHEN a user deletes a workout THEN the system SHALL call DELETE /api/workouts/{id} and refresh the list
5. WHEN workout forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL validate activity (1-100 chars), duration (1-600 min), and calories (0-2000)
6. WHEN workouts are displayed THEN they SHALL show activity, duration, calories burned, date, and action buttons

### Requirement 7: Health Score Visualization

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want to see my daily health scores with visual representations, so that I can understand my health trends over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user views health scores THEN the system SHALL call GET /api/health-index for current and historical data
2. WHEN health scores are displayed THEN the system SHALL use charts or graphs to show trends over time
3. WHEN a health score is shown THEN it SHALL include breakdowns of water, food, and exercise components
